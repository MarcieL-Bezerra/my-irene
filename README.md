# my-irene

My AI Irene, which is a Python AI that converses with Llama’s LLM model. The interaction between me and Irene is done through speech, which makes the experience even more natural and intuitive.

With Irene, I can have conversations on a variety of topics, from technical topics to more general questions. The AI’s ability to understand and answer my questions is impressive and opens up new possibilities for how we can work and interact with machines.
